# Roadmap for WikiPathways Development
_This is the official roadmap for WikiPathways and related development. These items have been proposed by Developers and approved by Architects. If you have a new idea to propose, add them as an [Issue](https://github.com/wikipathways/wikipathways.org/issues) and tag them with __[roadmap](https://github.com/wikipathways/wikipathways.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap)__. Architects should keep the roadmap prioritized and up-to-date. This document is publicly viewable, but only editable by WikiPathways Developers._

> The biggest single contribution users can help make to the project is by working on issues, bugs and features that are not necesarily related to this roadmap. That is because you have a unique understanding of what is lacking in the project, that would be great to hear. See README.md for more information about [contributing open source code](README.md).

## Broad Goals
1. Check in regularly with project collaborators and power users to make sure we continue to satisfy _real_ use cases.
2. Dynamic pathway views. Support changing the style of the background, cellular components, molecules and interactions. For example, swaping in molecular structures for chemicals, and swaping in styles optimized for publication and projector presentation. Also related: supporting data overlays.
3. Implement SBGN support for standarized modeling of nodes and interactions.
4. Pathway infobox. A new widget added to every pathway page with automatically generated [stats, annotations and links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xEqjevcMm9N50q-L3jQU5fQZ9Ubcj5wxWgmuztJVjM/edit?usp=sharing). This will be distinct from curated content, and standardized across all pathways.

## Specific Milestones for 2018
